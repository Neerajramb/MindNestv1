# Requirements Index and Traceability Matrix

This is the working index of every requirement in the specs (PRS 01, SRS 02, AI spec 08, Use-case/Test 04).
It exists so the PDFs never need to be re-read during implementation. Original wording lives in `docs/specs/`.

Status values: Not started · In progress · Implemented · Tested · Verified (demonstrated end-to-end) · Blocked · Deferred (approved).
